Automatically summons a configuration of minions.

NOTE SUMMONING ORDER

Step one: The mods summons 1 of the "FILL" summons
Step two: For each weapon summon the count of summons set, or fill all slots if weapon is set to fill

Given the way terraria handles resummons etc of weapons, if you try to summon a minion when you already 
are at max capacity, the FIRST minion will be overriden. This means if you set "count" > "maxMinions"
you will start overriding the minions you had.
